ChangeLog

SVN TRUNK

- MIDI Key pressure/polyphonic aftertouch events now properly
  recognized, in addition to MIDI channel pressure/aftertouch
  processing. (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Parameter value ramping moved into the late post-processing,
  an attempt to reduce some pop/click artifacts even further.
- NSM support introduced to JACK client. (EXPERIMENTAL)
- A slight GUI behavior change: (re)writing existing names
  doesn't load the respective preset anymore (after ticket
  by Jiri Prochazka aka. Anchakor, thanks).
- Introducing LV2 External UI rougue support. (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Moog-like 24dB/oct resonant filter slight modification.
- Fixed JACK client fail/fake initialization.
- Fixed a current element switching bug (via GUI) which was
  confusing the (stereo)width, panning and volume settings
  effect from previous selected elements. (TESTING)
- Fixed LV2 .ttl file index order (re. GEN1_GROUP, GEN1_COARSE).


0.3.2  2012-03-01  One third bug-fix release.

0.3.1  2012-02-08  One second bug-fix release.

- Improved filters parameter sensitivity (cutoff, reso).
- Envelope generators stage curves now gone a little more old-
  schooler and analog-like, hopefully improving on the punchy
  and click-less sound front.
- Experimental LV2 Time designated port support (Delay BPM). 
- Preparations for Qt5 migration.


0.3.0  2012-12-21  Third coming release.

- Dropped all SSE dummy build optimization flags as they were
  making more harm than real good, performance wise.

  for the formerly deprecated LV2 Event/MIDI specification.

  LV2 specification and compliance (as suggested by falkTX).
- Increased polyphony baseline from 24 to 32 voices.
- Prepared for relative paths from preset file references.

  8.3 filename formats.
- Velocity sensitivity configuration control has been added.
