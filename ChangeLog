ChangeLog

SVN TRUNK

- Envelope generators stage curves now gone a little more old-
  schooler and analog-like, hopefully improving on the punchy
  and click-less sound front. (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Improved filters parameter sensitivity (cutoff, reso).
- Experimental LV2 Time designated port support (Delay BPM). 
- Preparations for Qt5 migration. (TESTING)


0.3.0  2012-12-21  Third coming release.

- Dropped all SSE dummy build optimization flags as they were
  making more harm than real good, performance wise.
- GUI layout moved from a toolbox into a stacked tab widget;
  also, a status-bar has been added at the bottom display.

  for the formerly deprecated LV2 Event/MIDI specification.

- JACK stand-alone: preset loader initialization fix.


0.2.0  2012-11-22  Second public release.

  LV2 specification and compliance (as suggested by falkTX).

  8.3 filename formats.
